### HOW TO RUN
- To run executable file, enter ./a.out in terminal in the specific directory where the file is
- The inputs that are accepted are only numbers
- It will first ask to enter a positive integer to print out Fibonnaci numbers
- If an integer is not inserted, it will repeat the same message
- It will then ask for another positive integer
- It will then ask for a third positive integer and it must be less than the integer recently entered
